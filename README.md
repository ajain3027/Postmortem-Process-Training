# Postmortem-Process-Training

Postmortem: analysis of events that impacted some system or tools 

Postmortem Theory: Three Axioms
-Everyone acted in good faith: nobody do anything on purpose.
-Everyone is competent: all are humans only, mistakes happen.
-Doing this to find improvements: so that the same mistakes are not repeated and if occurs, we know how to deal with it.

during incident, response is driven by urgency within PagerDuty(2 settings):
-High urgency is a “full” page and means that it must be acknowledge and triaged immediately
-Low urgency is an email only page by default, and refers to business day suppo
